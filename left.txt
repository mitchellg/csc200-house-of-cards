I am so pleased I had a role in drafting this remarkable document. It embodies the values we hold dear as Democrats and as Americans, and it sets forth our great president's vision for our future where together we will reignite the American Dream for all. Because the reality is: Four years ago, the American Dream had slipped out of reach for too many, and it had turned into a nightmare for millions. President Obama changed our course. He invested in our future and put men and women back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges. He raised educational standards, invested in early childhood education, and worked to make higher education more affordable for everyone. He invested in clean energy and enacted the broadest tax cut in history, reducing taxes on the middle class to near-historic lows. He saved the American auto industry. He produced historic health reform. And he put forward a balanced deficit reduction plan that will put us on sound fiscal footing. Today, our economy is growing again. Our platform states that America faces a clear choice: move forward as a nation where everyone has the chance to get ahead, or go back to the same failed ideas that created the crisis in the first place. We will move forward, not backward. Republicans will raise taxes on low-income and the middle class to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. They'll end the fundamental guarantee of Medicare that people have earned. They'll let Wall Street write its own rules again. They'll allow the secret and unlimited special interest money in campaigns to advance its dangerous assault on our democracy. They'll shred the safety net and gut vital investments in education, innovation and infrastructure in order to help the wealthiest avoid doing their fair share. And they'll allow insurance companies to once again deny health care to working families and interfere with women's health care decisions. President Obama and Democrats will not let this happen. We will move forward, not backward. We believe we are bound together by a shared set of ideals and values rooted in the notion that together we can overcome the greatest challenges that come our way. We stand for an economy that's built not from the top down but from the middle out and that provides opportunity for those aspiring to join the middle class. And we make ending poverty a national priority. We are a big tent party of inclusion, and our platform speaks to the aspirations of all. Our platform ensures that the opportunity to live the American Dream not only survives but thrives for generations to come. We can't afford to go back or abandon the change we've fought so hard for. We will not turn back the clock. We can move forward. We must move forward. And under the leadership of President Obama, we will move forward. Thank you.

 We finally, after 16 days, at the last hours, were able to get to some agreement that is really very short-lived. The continuing resolution only lasts 'til the middle of January—on Martin Luther King's birthday, ironically—and the debt ceiling expires on February 7th. So, this is merely kicking the can down the road, as they say. I think it’s important, but I’m still trying to rationalize how the non-tea-party Republicans in the House can let the tea-party-oriented members in their caucus control everything. And it’s really kind of disappointing, because you can’t negotiate whether—over a dispute over one measure, which creates healthcare for millions of Americans that can’t afford it, that we would close down the funding of the entire government. This is a tactic that is so obviously out of place and makes the legislative process literally unworkable. And so it’s my hope that we can figure out a way to get this rolling again. Speaker Boehner is in an incredible position, and his legacy is going to be determined by whether he continues to cave in to the ultra-conservatives in his caucus or not. To his credit, it seemed to me that he wanted to be more cooperative, but he was afraid of even being dismissed from the speakership. I think he’s over that kind of a hump, but it’s at a cost of $24 billion, 800,000 people out of work. And then the government, after we signed it late last night, they say, "All government workers, please come to work the very next day."

 No, no, not at all. And, you know, the president has been stable, and he and Majority Leader Reid, they set a good example for us. And I think that he’s got to really create a legacy that has a lot more to do with putting everybody back to work. The recession is not over yet. The recovery is slow. Unemployment is still way too high. And there’s so much more that we could do. And to think that you would have so many members, 144 in the House and 18 in the Senate, who would say, "Well, there’s nothing wrong with shutting down the whole government, not raising the debt ceiling, and really hurting the credit rating of the largest, most powerful country in civilization." And it’s just unimaginable, the actions that they would turn to to get their way on a very small and modest bill, "Obamacare." We’re talking about universal healthcare for everybody, single-payer. That’s what the new direction is. And yet, this kind of "everything or nothing, and we’re going to get our way on any bill," that kind of an attitude destroys, really, or compromises the democratic legislative process—

 I rise to strongly oppose HR 1062.  This bill places significant additional requirements for economic analysis by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), effectively bringing any efforts at rulemaking to a standstill.  Let’s be clear: the purpose of this legislative effort is to stop implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act dead in its tracks.  After losing in Congress, the fight against the Dodd-Frank Act moved to the courts, beginning with overturning the proxy access rules they adopted under authority provided by that Act.  Although I agreed fully with the SEC’s position, a court found that the SEC did not meet its already significant requirements to conduct an economic analysis. After the proxy access case was overturned, the SEC adopted improved standards for conducting cost-benefit analyses.  These procedures were cited by the GAO last December as having all the elements of good regulatory analysis. Basically what the GAO is saying, we took a look we studied it and they do a good job. Nonetheless, the bill before us today adds even more requirements, tying up SEC resources and putting it at even greater risk of litigation for every rule.  Despite the assurances of my Republican colleagues that they are only applying the terms of an executive order to the SEC, that executive order explicitly protects agencies from lawsuits based on their economic analysis. HR 1062 has no such protection for the SEC. The Commission is undertaking a valiant effort to finish the Dodd-Frank and JOBS Act rules, even in the face of attempts by the majority to restrict their funding.  As the SEC attempts to balance capital formation with the need to protect investors, this bill weights the scales heavily in favor of industry over investors.  In fact, the words “investor protection” do not appear anywhere in this bill.  Even without this bill, we can count on industry lobbyists to sue the SEC any time it sees a weakness in the justification supporting a rule, as they have in several other cases currently before the courts. And this bill does not apply only to new rules.  This is extraordinary, and I want to say this so everybody understands. This bill would require the Commission to review every rulemaking ever issued – even those that have protected our securities markets since the Great Depression – one year after the adoption of this bill, and every 5 years thereafter.  As a result, the Commission will be forced to divert resources away from other key areas, such as enforcement.  This comes at a time when House Republicans want to hold SEC funding flat, despite the SEC’s new responsibilities, the increase in the number of participants it oversees, and the growth of complexity and size of US securities markets.  It is ironic that, as House Republicans push this bill forward, they also are calling for the SEC to speed up its efforts on JOBS Act rules.  This bill makes it impossible for the SEC to meet the very deadline we adopted just two days ago when we passed HR 701. I urge my colleagues to oppose HR 1062.

 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank Mr. Van Hollen for yielding me time. Today I rise in strong opposition to the Republicans' budget, a budget that makes absurd claims to reducing the deficit by repealing crucial government authority to protect our economy. Lest we forget that Lehman Brothers' disorderly bankruptcy sparked the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Should a megabank fail in the future, the Dodd-Frank Act specifically authorizes regulators to dissolve the failing firm, fire its executives, wipe out shareholders and deny the claims of creditors. The gentleman from Wisconsin calls this a bailout, erroneously, concluding that the Dodd-Frank Act enshrines “Too Big to Fail” when in fact it provides all the necessary tools to end it. If Dodd-Frank actually did what the Republicans say, why does no large firm want to be designated as “Systemically Significant?” The Republican proposal also deceptively suggests that a repeal of the liquidation authority generates real savings to the American taxpayer. The Dodd-Frank legislation designed this authority to pay for itself over time, with any initial upfront costs being completely recouped by selling assets and imposing an assessment after the resolution on financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets. The law specifically states that taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any authority under the liquidation title. Once again, the Republican budget is misleading and dishonest. The National Journal has called the Republican proposal a budget gimmick and even The Wall Street Journal dismissed it as mere budget quirks. If the authority to wind down a mega firm is repealed, the American taxpayer will be called on again to bear the risk of another financial crisis like 2008, which the G.A.O. found cost the U.S. economy $13 trillion.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to reject this Republican budget. I yield back the balance of my time.

 Thank you so very much, Congressman Meeks. I am so proud of the members of this Congress from both sides of the aisle, who have been real advocates, who have been on television, who have been fighting. Members on the opposite side of the aisle have criticized their own leadership for the delay. Ladies and Gentleman, I am from California. I have witnessed earthquake disaster. I have been involved with trying to help with Hurricane Katrina, and making sure that the people who were the victims of Katrina were compensated and were taken care of. This is unconscionable that this has had to take so long. I’ve watched Congressman Meeks up in Rockaway. I’ve watched the people who cried, I’ve watched the people who begged for help, who begged for assistance. This is so late in coming. And so I support this bill today. I am one of the co-authors of the Flood Insurance Reauthorization Bill, along with Ms. Biggert, who reauthorized flood insurance for another five years. Let’s put the money in it. Let’s do what’s right. Let’s take care of this disaster.

 Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from California, Maxine Waters. Ms. WATERS. I thank my friend from Michigan, Congressman Sander Levin, for the time. I rise to oppose this so-called free trade agreement. I find it deeply disturbing that the United States Congress is even considering a free trade agreement with a country that holds the world's record for assassinations of trade unionists and would cause a loss of 55,000 jobs in the United States.  The Congressional Black Caucus has been working hard to create jobs. We've held job fares in five cities in the country. We have been working hard to create jobs because the unemployment rate in this country is unacceptable: 9.1 throughout the country, 11.3 for Latinos, 16 percent for African Americans. We need jobs, not an unfair trade agenda. Additionally, according to Colombia's National Labor School, 51 trade labor unionists were assassinated in 2010. That's more than the rest of the world combined. In addition, 21 unionists survived attempts on their lives, 338 unionists received death threats, 35 were forcibly displaced, 34 were arbitrarily detained, and 7 just disappeared in 2010. Another 23 unionists have been assassinated so far this year, and a total of 2,908 union members have been murdered in Colombia since 1986. And the Colombian Attorney General's Office has not obtained any convictions for these murders for the past 4 years.  The people of Colombia don't need a free trade agreement; they need a government that respects the rights of all of its citizens. Let's vote down this trade agenda and tell the Government of Colombia that there can be no free trade without human rights and human dignity.

 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have left a legacy of pain, both physical and mental, for our servicemen and women and their families. This morning, our nation awoke to the grim details coming out of Fort Hood, Texas.  Yesterday, a troubled veteran opened fire on base leaving four dead and 16 wounded.  The soldier, Army specialist Ivan Lopez, served in Iraq and was seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress, took his own life. As a Naval psychiatrist during the Vietnam War, I saw personally the gruesome toll long, brutal wars have on warriors and their families; the personal trauma they suffer lasts long after combat officially ends. The further removed we become from the major combat operations of the past decade, the more the sacrifices of our warriors threaten to fade from our memory.  But this tragedy at Fort Hood, combined with the unacceptable reality of 22 servicemember suicides a day, illustrates the immense challenge before us: to care for those men and women who went to fight for us. It is now time to recommit ourselves as a nation to the moral obligation we have in providing the long-term care our veterans so deserve.   That commitment begins with Democrats and Republicans working together in Congress to make the issues of servicemember suicides and mental health care for our veterans a top, fierce and urgent priority.

 Of all of the challenges facing our nation’s health-care system, perhaps the most neglected is the gaping hole in our workforce of primary-care physicians. One estimate projects a shortage of 45,000 primary-care doctors by 2020. This bill will go a long way towards addressing that shortage, improving health outcomes, and reducing the nation’s health care costs. With the retirement of a generation of physicians, the aging of our population, and the coming entry into the system of some 30 million newly insured thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we do not have enough primary-care doctors to meet the demand, and the problem will continue to worsen without a major initiative to produce new doctors. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we are going to get close to universal health coverage in the United States. But universal coverage will not be meaningful if we don’t have enough doctors to serve our population. I am optimistic that Congress can demonstrate leadership in restoring our doctor workforce for the next generation.

 As we begin Women’s History Month, we recognize the tremendous progress that our country has made in advancing women’s rights as well as highlight the work still to be done.  Investing in access to quality education, healthcare, and economic empowerment of women and girls are critical to our national security.  Yet discrimination against women’s basic rights have come under acute attack in recent years -- particularly the right to access contraception -- as politicians use women’s rights to turn back the clock.  Indeed, it’s hard for me to believe that in 2012, we are arguing about whether large employers like hospitals and universities should be exempt on religious grounds from a requirement to provide contraceptive coverage as a basic element of a woman’s health-benefits package.  It’s even harder for me to believe that a Congressional panel on the topic of contraception invited five men to testify, and excluded the only female witness from speaking.  Meanwhile, violence against women in our country continue to persist at a startling rate – one in four women has been a victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in her lifetime.  Clearly, we need to better understand ways to protect and empower women and girls. Today, women still bear the brunt of poverty, war, and famine globally. That is why I support the first-ever U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, proposed by President Obama in December 2011, that prescribes specific ways to empower half the world’s population as equal partners in preventing conflict and building peace.  In honor of Women’s History Month, join me in celebrating the accomplishments of great women around the world and supporting the next generation of female leaders.

 I applaud President Obama for making history today as the first sitting President to support full marriage equality.  Without question his words today will shape the course of equality for generations to come.  I am proud of the President for his courage in taking this historic step on the path of justice and equal rights – and I walk proudly with him to make our dream of equality a reality.

 I am pleased the U.S. Department of Education has granted Washington state a waiver from provisions in the No Child Left Behind law.  NCLB’s one-size-fits-all approach has not fit well with the reforms we, in Washington state, believe are needed for high standards and accountability.  By returning many education decisions to the state and local levels, the waiver will allow Washington state educators to better meet the individualized needs of our students and ensure they have the critical skills and knowledge to succeed upon graduation.

As we mark Equal Pay Day, I applaud President Obama's executive actions today to help combat pay discrimination and strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws for women. The President is signing an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their pay with each other.  The President is also instructing the Labor Department to establish new regulations requiring federal contractors to submit compensation data paid to their employees, including data by sex and race.
 
Equal pay for equal work has been one of my top priorities dating back to the women's movement when I served on the Board of the Ms. Foundation for Women. I have worked with Gloria Steinem, Eleanor Smeal, Patsy Mink and many other women pioneers in the women's movement to highlight issues affecting working women, and to create and support public policy for equal treatment for all women.
 
Even with President Obama's executive action's today and enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Act in 2009, there’s still more work to do in Congress. We should pledge to advance the When Women Succeed, America Succeeds: An Economic Agenda for Women and Families unveiled last year by House Democrats. This economic agenda includes key women’s issues like fair pay, work and family balance and childcare. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a critical component of When Women Succeed, America Succeeds.  It is time to pass this long-overdue legislation to ensure equal pay for women in the workplace. The Paycheck Fairness Act would modernize the landmark Equal Pay Act by providing effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for doing equal work.

Equal pay is not a woman’s issue – it’s a family issue. Today, American families increasingly rely on women’s wages to make ends meet. To some, 23 cents on the dollar pay gap may seem small, but for the average American woman, this disparity amounts to lost income each year – income that could be used for food, clothes, rent and other basic necessities. I will continue to fight for fairness and equality for women in California and across America.

Unemployment insurance is a critical lifeline for millions of families. In 2012, it kept 2.5 million people above the poverty line, including 600,000 children. Since Republicans let the program expire just three days after Christmas – more than 2 million Americans, including nearly 340,000 here in California, have been deprived of the support they need to get back on their feet. Recently, I spoke at a community rally in Los Angeles, hosted by a coalition of labor unions and community organizations, calling on Congressional Republicans to extend Federal unemployment insurance benefits. I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues to stop playing politics with this critical lifeline and act immediately to extend unemployment insurance. Every one of us has felt the pain of losing a job. Whether it’s a spouse, friend or relative – we all know someone who – in the last few years – has fallen on hard times. And we all know the enormous strain, stress and heartache experienced by those families unsure of where their next paycheck is coming from. A large number of those who are unable to find work require new skills for the new economy. And it is our obligation to give them a boost while they refine those skills and identify new career opportunities.
