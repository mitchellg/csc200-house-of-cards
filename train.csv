"The Senate, I am learning, is an institution bound by tradition and precedent.",right
"One of the time-honored and worthwhile traditions in this body is that new senators are, for at least the first few months of their service, are to be essentially seen and not heard until they deliver their maiden speeches on the Senate floor.",right
"This, Mr. President, I am doing today.",right
"As an aside, in the same vein of new senators traditionally not being heard but seen, I may have been well advised for the first few months to avoid the throngs of reporters who congregate outside of this chamber, but it's too late for that.",right
"Politicians, after all, can only heed so much advice.",right
"For the past 12 years, it was my privilege to serve in the House of Representatives, a body that has its own traditions and precedents.",right
"At its core, the House is governed by the concept of majority rule.",right
"One party can have a majority of only one or two and, by virtue of the rules, can maintain control of that chamber.",right
"During my time in the House, I had the experience of being in both the majority and in the minority.",right
"All things equal, I preferred the former, but I understood that the power wielded by being in the majority is fleeting.",right
"That is as it should be.",right
"The Senate, on the other hand, is a body governed by consensus.",right
"The party holding the gavel is on a short leash.",right
"Bringing even the most non-controversial resolutions to the Senate floor requires the agreement, or at least the acquiescence of the minority party.",right
"Over the past decade, both parties have chaffed under these arrangements.",right
"Both parties have at times considered changing the rules that would in some measure make the Senate more like the House.",right
"Both parties have wisely reconsidered.",right
"The House has rules appropriate for the House.",right
"The rules of the Senate, however frustrating to the party that happens to wield the gavel, are appropriate for the Senate.",right
"I come to this point with great appreciation for those Arizona senators who have preceded me.",right
"The 48th state in the union, Arizona celebrated its centennial just last year.",right
"Prior to my swearing in this year, Arizona had sent just 10 senators to this body.",right
"These Arizonans who came before me have left more of an impression than simply carving their names in these desks.",right
"Few in this body have matched the longevity of Carl Hayden.",right
"Few have had the lasting impact of Barry Goldwater, who helped launch a conservative movement.",right
"I consider it a high honor to follow in the footsteps of Senator Jon Kyl, whose steady, principled leadership shaped Arizona for the better and made our nation stronger, and more secure.",right
"My constituents now call the same telephone number I answered as an intern for Senator Dennis DeConcini.",right
"He taught me a great deal about constituent service.",right
"And now I have the incredible honor to serve with Senator John McCain, who as a prisoner of war taught us all the meaning of sacrifice.",right
"Since that time, he has served Arizona, the country, and the Senate nobly and honorably.",right
"Fortunately for all of us, his service to this institution continues.",right
"It is my great privilege to serve with him.",right
"The challenges America faces today are legion and growing.",right
"Abroad, cells of terrorists bent on our destruction continue to incubate.",right
"Some receive aid and comfort from countries with long held grievances and irreconcilable enmity toward the United States.",right
"Other terrorists take advantage of failed states and lawless regions to hatch their plans.",right
"But it is not just individual terrorists or terror cells that we have to worry about.",right
"Countries unbound by the norms and conventions of traditional nation-states now threaten the peace.",right
"Today, our concern is primarily focused on Iran and North Korea, but myriad other countries are but one election or coup removed from boiling over into regional and international instability.",right
"Here at home, our fiscal situation is dire.",right
"We continue to spend considerably more than we take in.",right
"Worse yet, we have no serious plan to remedy the problem in any structural way.",right
"We seem to endlessly lurch from cliff to crisis and back again, with fiscal high wire acts that erode the confidence of markets and invite the distain of our constituents.",right
"It is understandable that with two-year election cycles, the House of Representatives begins to focus on the next election as soon as one election season is finished.",right
"In the House, difficult issues are often avoided or perpetually shelved until the next election.",right
"But here in the Senate we have six-year terms.",right
"Senators, therefore, should come with an added dose of courage to take up the thorny and vexing issues on which the other chamber takes a pass.",right
"It is our responsibility to lead, and if there was ever a time for this body, this chamber, the United States Senate, to lead, this is it.",right
"I am a proud and unapologetic conservative, and a Republican, and I hope my votes will consistently reflect that philosophy.",right
"So I am not suggesting that we hold hands and agree on every issue, or even most issues.",right
"There are profound and meaningful differences between the parties.",right
"But I want to spend more time exercising my franchise while debating the legislation itself, and less time on deciding whether such legislation should be debated on the Senate floor.",right
"There is a time and a place for using supermajority rules to block legislation and/or nominees from coming to the Senate floor.",right
"There is a time and place for partisanship.",right
"But not every time, and not every place.",right
"This country yearns for a functioning Senate, a Senate that recognizes the gravity of our fiscal situation and its responsibility to propose and adopt measures to solve it for the long term.",right
"This country yearns for a Senate that exercises its prerogative as part of the first branch of government, to rein in executive branch excesses in both domestic and foreign affairs.",right
"Domestically, the parade of missteps and abuses at the IRS and other federal agencies stand as exhibit A of the need for more robust legislative direction and oversight.",right
"Recent presidents both Republican and Democratic have exercised authority in the foreign arena far beyond that contemplated for a commander in chief, often obligating future congresses to financial commitments far beyond security arrangements.",right
"A better functioning Senate, less distracted by games of shirts and skins, would not countenance such theft of its authority.",right
"Now is not the time, Madam President, for this institution to retreat into irrelevance, where the sum of our influence is to sign off on another continuing resolution to fund the government for another six months.",right
"Where success is measured by how well our tracks are covered when the debt ceiling is raised.",right
"Where prioritizing spending cuts are avoided by invoking another sequester.",right
"No, we've been there, done that.",right
"It's time now for the Senate to lead.",right
"There are encouraging signs that we may be moving in this direction.",right
"Earlier this year, a budget was passed by this chamber.",right
"It wasn't a budget that I perferred, but I was given ample opportunity to offer and debate amendments to that legislation, as were my Republican colleagues.",right
"We came up short.",right
"But at least the Senate got back to regular order.",right
"In the coming weeks this body will consider an immigration bill.",right
"Immigration reform has been and remains a complex and vexing issue with members holding strong and discordant views on many of its facets.",right
"Still, the bill, having had a thorough vetting in committee, will be allowed to come to the Senate floor to be debated, amended, and hopefully improved upon.",right
"This is the way it should work.",right
"To conclude, Madam President, a few days after last November's election, the twelve newly elected Senate freshmen were invited to the National Archives.",right
"We were taken to the legislative vault where we viewed the original, signed copy of the first bill enacted by Congress, as well as other landmark pieces of legislation and memorabilia.",right
"Oaths of allegiance signed by Revolutionary War soldiers, witnessed by General Washington, documents and artifacts related to the civil war, segregation and women's suffrage were also on hand.",right
"It was an affirmation to me of the tumultuous seas through which our ship of state has sailed for more than 200 years.",right
"We have had many brilliant and inspired individuals at the helm, and trimming the sails along the way.",right
"We've also had personalities ranging from mediocre to malevolent.",right
"But our system of government has survived them all.",right
"Serious challenges lie ahead, but any honest reckoning of our history and our prospects will note that we have confronted and survived more daunting challenges than we now face.",right
"This is a durable, resilient system of government, designed to withstand the foibles of men, including yours truly.",right
"Madam President, it is the honor of a lifetime just to be here in this storied institution - more than I could have ever hoped for.",right
"My modest hope going forward is that my contributions will in some small way honor the Senate's storied past and help it realize its full potential as the world's most deliberative body.",right
"Thank you.",right
"I yield the floor.",right
"I take the floor today to speak in support of the Hoeven-Corker amendment that will soon be filed.",right
"Let me just say that the goal of the so called Gang of Eight has always been to bring forward, from Congress, a solution to our broken immigration system.",right
"We introduced our bill knowing full well that it would be a starting point for this legislative process.",right
"We had, under Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley's purview, a great markup in the Judiciary Committee.",right
"It went on for days.",right
"More than 300 amendments filed, more than 100 adopted.",right
"We have had a full-throated debate in this chamber already on this bill.",right
"And out of this vetting and this debate that we've had, we have had several consistent messages on things that need to be improved in the legislation.",right
"And what we're doing right now, I think, is going a long way to deal with these concerns.",right
"We have heard that we have allowed too much discretion to write the strategy for the border security plan; we have given too much to the Department of Homeland Security that will simply spend billions of dollars that will be appropriated eventually.",right
"This amendment includes a detailed list of technologies that will have to be put in place by the department.",right
"We will set a minimum floor of what they have to do, and then they can go beyond that.",right
"We require that a strategy is deployed in the underlying legislation; that an entry-exit system for all airports and seaports be in place; and that E-Verify be up and running for all business in the United States before anyone is granted legal permanent residency.",right
"There are persistent concerns that that still won't be sufficient to ensure a secure border, that we need more incentive there.",right
"This amendment, filed by Senators Hoeven and Corker, will require 700 miles of fence be completed and that we have double the number of border agents that we currently have.",right
"These things have to be done before anybody in provisional status adjusts to get a green card.",right
"This is important; this amendment dramatically increases the trigger that will have to be met in order for anyone, as I said, who is in provisional status, to adjust to get a green card.",right
"This is a product of the ongoing scrutiny that this bill has received; the scrutiny that it deserves.",right
"We said from the very beginning that this bill deserves debate - due process, through committee and on the floor in this chamber.",right
"And it is receiving that today and it is a better bill for it.",right
"It is going to be considerably improved particularly after the Hoeven-Corker amendment is introduced and hopefully adopted.",right
"I hope that in the coming days we'll also have as much scrutiny on the positive aspects of this bill.",right
"State and local governments currently deal with a sizable undocumented population; all of them, particularly in Arizona.",right
"Businesses are looking for a legal workforce that they simply don't have access to right now.",right
"Right now the best and the brightest come here, we educate them in our universities, and then we send them home to compete against us because we won't allow them to stay on a visa.",right
"The U.S. economy, overall, could use the boost that will come if we can pass meaningful immigration reform.",right
"Again I support this amendment.",right
"I commend my colleagues from Tennessee and North Dakota and all those who are working in the Gang of Eight and elsewhere.",right
"There are some who say that many people are trying to kill this bill and bring poison pill amendments.",right
"For the most part what I've seen are people who want to improve this legislation, to make it better.",right
"To deal with this problem in a way that will solve it for good, so we don't have to return to this a couple years from now.",right
"Again, I appreciate my colleagues for offering the amendment.",right
"I look forward to discussing it either this weekend or next week.",right
"This is the first appropriation bill that we are considering for FY2014.",right
"Unfortunately in my view, it gets us off to the wrong foot because of the spending level.",right
"The bill spends more than $54 billion.",right
"That's about 5 billion dollars above last year's spending level and more than $10 billion over the House proposal for this coming fiscal year.",right
"Considering that our debt stands at over $17 trillion, we ought to be spending less, not more, this year.",right
"This bill already takes a larger portion of the total allowable spending compared to last year.",right
"People will point out that the budget agreement that we agreed to in 2011 simply sets an aggregate number and that we can spend whatever we want in certain appropriation bills as long as the total doesn't come over $967 billion.",right
"That is true.",right
"But it is impossible - and I can say that with experience in the House and now in the Senate - that if you overspend on the initial appropriation bills that you will somehow cut back in the bills that come later.",right
"Often the last bill to come up is a defense bill; nobody is going to undercut our troops or spend less in a defense bill, but that would be required if we were to stay under the budget control agreement number.",right
"So when we overspend on the initial appropriation bills like this, it simply means one thing: that we are going to bust the budget.",right
"I can tell you, to have any credibility with the taxpayers, we've got to stick to the agreement that was agreed to in 2011.",right
"We have so far.",right
"We even went through the sequester because we couldn't come up with an agreement to prioritize spending.",right
"But now to go over on the first appropriation bill, to go over the spending limit, would not set the right precedent moving ahead into the appropriation bills.",right
"We've simply got to deal with this debt and deficit and this isn't the way to go.",right
"That's why I support the upcoming motion to recommit that Senator Toomey will offer, that would simply recommit the bill back to the Appropriations Committee and say, come back with something that fits within the Budget Control Act that is similar to what was spent last year, not overspending by $5 billion.",right
"I hope that we all pass this motion to recommit.",right
"I hope that we all start off on appropriation bills in the Senate on the right foot.Mr.",right
"President, I speak today recognizing that I have been a member of this body for just six months and a few days.",right
"I'm hardly an expert on Senate rules, procedures and precedents.",right
"But this much I do know: The rule change that is being considered this week is more far-reaching and significant than has been advertised.",right
"This rule change was described this afternoon by the majority leader as minor change, no big deal.",right
"It is a big deal, and it has the potential to change this institution in ways that are both hazardous and unforeseen.",right
"We will discuss these changes later today as we meet together in the old chamber.",right
"It is appropriate that we should meet in the old chamber, which hasn't been used for official Senate business for around 150 years.",right
"It gives added perspective about the gravity of what is being considered.",right
"The majority leader noted today that Senate rules have been changed 18 times in the past 36 years by a simple majority vote.",right
"There needs to be a qualifier here - a very big qualifier: This rule change will allow, for the first time in Senate history, majority-imposed cloture.",right
"This is not minor.",right
"This is a big deal.",right
"It is said by the advocates that this will only affect the president's executive branch nominees.",right
"That may be true initially, but once a simple majority has been used to impose cloture for executive branch nominees, why can't it be used to for judicial nominees who have lifetime tenure?",right
"Why won't it be used for everyday legislation?",right
"But even in the unlikely event that this rule change remained confined to the president's executive branch nominees, it would not be a minor change, or one that could be described as no big deal.",right
"Let me give an example.",right
"One that I hope will give some of my colleagues pause as they consider this rule change.",right
"Currently under consideration by this body is the president's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency.",right
"This agency has broad reach across the country.",right
"Its regulatory authority extends to power generation and air quality.",right
"A heavy handed approach to these issues in particular has the potential to put a strangle hold on Arizona's economy.",right
"With only 15 percent of Arizona's land privately owned, EPA's influence is magnified by the considerable footprint the federal government already has in the state.",right
"So, the president's choice to head the EPA is an important choice, and the Senate's advice and consent role is vital.",right
"After reading some of the media reporting on the president's pick for this position, I initially had some heartburn.",right
"However, after meeting in my office with the president's nominee, discussing some of the issues unique to Arizona, and receiving assurances that we could, where appropriate, work collaboratively on these issues, I felt comfortable with the president's choice.",right
"On the whole, this has been my experience.",right
"Now, if this rule that we are about to consider were in place, would I have received a visit from the president's nominee?",right
"No!",right
"I served in the House of Representatives for 12 years.",right
"I never once received a visit from one of the president's nominees during the nomination process.",right
"Why is this?",right
"It's not because Arizona didn't have issues that needed attention or collaboration, or because these nominees have an aversion to the other chamber.",right
"It is because the House has no role in advice and consent.",right
"This is precisely the position that nearly half of the Senate will be in, in perpetuity, with regard to executive branch nominees by the end of this week if this change occurs.",right
"Mr. President, in my maiden Senate speech just a few months ago, I said the following:    The Senate is a body governed largely by consensus.",right
"The party holding the gavel is on a short leash.",right
"Bringing even the most non-controversial resolutions to the Senate floor requires the agreement or at least the acquiescence of the minority.",right
"Over the past decade both parties wielding the gavel have chafed under this arrangement.",right
"Both parties have at times considered changing the rules.",right
"Both parties have wisely reconsidered.",right
"The House has rules appropriate for the House.",right
"The rules of the Senate, however frustrating to the party that happens to wield the gavel, are appropriate for the Senate.",right
"Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this body can realize its potential, and that whatever behavioral changes need to be made are made within the longstanding rules of the Senate, rules that have served this institution and the country for more than 200 years.",right
"I rise to discuss the nomination of Mr. Debo Adegbile to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.",right
"I attended Mr. Adegbile's hearing in the Judiciary Committee and submitted additional written questions after the hearing.",right
"Unfortunately, even after hearing his testimony and reviewing his responses to questions, I remain concerned with Mr. Adegbile's ability to set aside more than a decade of advocacy on behalf of this and other liberal causes and serve as a neutral enforcer of our nation's civil rights laws.",right
"It appears I am not the only person who has reached this conclusion.",right
"His nomination is opposed by numerous law enforcement officers, including those represented by: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Association of Police Organizations, the New Jersey State Policeman's Benevolent Association, and the National Narcotic Officers' Association.",right
"This widespread opposition is clearly not driven by partisanship, but by a heartfelt concern that this nominee is not suited for the position.",right
"I have no doubt Mr. Adegbile is an intelligent and hardworking lawyer with a commendable record of advocacy, but that does not mean he should head the Civil Rights Division.",right
"One of the responsibilities of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division is to handle citizens' allegations of civil rights violations by law enforcement officers from across the country.",right
"However, serious questions have been raised about Mr. Adegbile's ability to apply the law fairly in these cases, given his advocacy on behalf of a convicted cop killer.",right
"As the Fraternal Order of Police stated in its letter of opposition, in the decades Mr. Adegbile pushed this effort, he falsely disparaged and savaged the good name and reputation of a lifeless police officer in order to further his case.",right
"The National Narcotic's Association shares this analysis of Mr. Adegbile's advocacy, noting that he fabricated a baseless and unproven defense while also defaming the victim, Police Officer Daniel Faulkner, which raises serious questions about the nominee's judgment, especially considering the important position to which he has been nominated.",right
"There was no doubt as to Mumia Abu-Jamal's guilt.",right
"Afterward, he bragged about shooting Daniel Faulkner, and four witnesses saw the shooting.",right
"After being convicted and sentenced, Mumia's lawyers filed dozens of appeals on his behalf, which would suggest he had more than adequate legal representation.",right
"However, almost 28 years after his conviction, Mr. Adegbile decided to volunteer his time to assist Mumia.",right
"In a series of appeals and press events, Mr. Adegbile's organization called into question the motivations of the law enforcement officers responsible for Mumia's conviction, and distorted the record, calling his conviction and sentence a relic of a time and place that was notorious for police abuse and racial discrimination.",right
"As the Philadelphia's district attorney's opposition letter states, Mr. Adegbile's work on this case sends a message of contempt to police officers who risk their lives every day to maintain the peace.",right
"The DA concluded that Mr. Adegbile is ill-suited for a pivotal role in the Justice Department.",right
"The appalling facts of this case are well-known.",right
"In fact, in 2006, the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the history of this case and recognizing the culpability of Mumia by a vote of 368-31.",right
"There are others, like me, now serving in this chamber who voted in favor of that resolution.",right
"It is deeply troubling that we are faced with voting on this nominee now, after Senate rules have been broken and the minority has no say in executive or judicial nominations.",right
"Requiring the support of at least some minority senators discourages both the nomination and appointment of fringe or problematic nominees - something that benefits the country as a whole.",right
"Those rules ensured that the Senate was the cooling saucer that George Washington and the other founders intended.",right
"And they ensured that the heads of executive agencies were responsive to both the majority and minority parties.",right
"I do not think we would be moving forward on such a divisive nominee - one who elicits widespread opposition from across the political spectrum - if the majority had not employed the nuclear option last November.",right
"Mr. President, I hope we don't move forward with this nomination.",right
"I hope my colleagues will join me and others in voicing opposition to this nomination moving ahead.",right
"Few qualities are more American than a zeal for fair play.",right
"That's why, when reports emerged last spring that the Internal Revenue Service was targeting conservative groups applying for a certain tax-exempt status, fair-minded folks of all political stripes expressed outrage.",right
"Far from being a fringe conspiracy theory, the discovery of government-sanctioned bias against conservative organizations requesting 501(c)(4) status was reported by none other than the IRS' own inspector general.",right
"Since that discovery, several IRS employees - including the acting commissioner - have resigned, and the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Department of Justice are each conducting investigations.",right
"But despite the scorching questioning of IRS leaders and well-founded condemnation from all corners, the agency still has not learned its lesson on impartiality.",right
"What the IRS can't do with permission it seems determined to do by fiat.",right
"On Nov. 29, 2013, the agency published a proposed rule that would further trample on the free-speech rights of 501(c)(4) organizations and restrict their activities.",right
"The rule singles out the same conservative groups previously targeted by the IRS and threatens to limit their participation in a host of advocacy and educational activities, even nonpartisan voter-registration and education drives.",right
"These activities have a clear role in promoting civic engagement and social welfare - the exact purpose of the 501(c)(4) designation.",right
"The IRS' proposed rule would force groups such as the National Taxpayers Union and the American Civil Liberties Union to quit such activities or risk losing their tax-exempt status.",right
"Proponents of the rule claim it is necessary to clear up confusion about tax exemption and to bring greater transparency to political spending.",right
"This is little more than a convenient cover to quiet conservative critics while leaving others free to engage in political discourse.",right
"The administration should pay attention to the liberal groups denouncing this proposed rule and its detrimental impact.",right
"The ACLU slammed the rule as producing the same structural issues at the IRS that led to the use of inappropriate criteria in the selection of various charitable and social welfare groups for undue scrutiny.",right
"The Alliance for Justice Action Campaign and even the Sierra Club have been equally critical.",right
"In three months, more than 140,000 comments were submitted, the most for any rule-making.",right
"To halt this latest attempt to quash free speech, I introduced the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act, which would prohibit for one year the finalization of this proposed rule.",right
"It would also prevent additional targeting of 501(c)(4) groups by restoring the IRS standards and definitions that were in place before the agency began going after conservative organizations.",right
"The House of Representatives recently passed an identical bill, and the Senate legislation already has 40 co-sponsors.",right
"It deserves the support of the full Senate.",right
"However, Democrats have refused to allow the bill to come to the floor for debate and a vote.",right
"And President Obama has issued a veto threat against it.",right
"That threat is a clearly disproportionate response to legislation aimed at protecting free-speech rights of conservatives and liberals alike.",right
"It also demonstrates how badly the Obama administration wants to sweep this problem under the rug while silencing any remaining critics.",right
"My bill is simple and fair: It merely suspends new IRS rule-making regarding 501(c)(4) groups until the ongoing investigations are completed.",right
"When a powerful government agency has a problem with bias and abuse, that's exactly what Congress should be doing - and the least the public should expect - until this issue is resolved.",right
"Nowhere else in the country are people more keenly aware of the value of water than here in the desert Southwest.",right
"It's the lifeblood of our communities.",right
"Yet growing demands on shared water supplies have generated intense interest and regional tensions.",right
"Throughout our country and around the world, water continues to be one of the most important issues of our time.",right
"That is why I am pleased to announce that on Saturday, World Water Day, I am launching a yearlong conversation on domestic and international water issues.",right
"This project will focus on bringing attention to water-security challenges with an eye toward identifying effective policies that could inform water-management decisions.",right
"I look forward to tapping the reservoir of expertise we have in Arizona at the Department of Water Resources, the University of Arizona's Water Resource Research Center, and Arizona State University's Morrison Institute, among others.",right
"For more than a century, Arizona has been on the cutting edge of water management, and our breadth of experience will ensure we can successfully tackle the water challenges ahead.",right
"Arizona as we know it today is due in large part to the historic vision that led to the development of the Salt River Project, construction of Roosevelt Dam and creation of the Central Arizona Project.",right
"We continued with the passage of prudent conservation policies such as the Groundwater Management Code.",right
"Because we are home to 22 federally recognized American Indian tribes, we have also had the opportunity to work on mutually beneficial water settlements.",right
"Our location along the border has enabled us to be a part of water treaty negotiations with Mexico.",right
"This diverse set of water challenges, and Arizona's know-how in addressing them, will serve as a valuable resource for the rest of the United States and the world.",right
"With recent events in California and continued attention on global water scarcity in Africa and elsewhere, it is clear the time for a conversation about water policy is now.",right
"Hundreds of millions of people at home and abroad face issues with access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene.",right
"Thankfully, leaders like Gov.",right
"Jan Brewer and former Sen. Jon Kyl, along with others in the water community, have helped pave the way to address these problems in Arizona.",right
"With the release of Arizona's Strategic Water Vision in January and Kyl's work with the Morrison Institute to refine that discussion, the state is proactively looking at ways to plan our future.",right
"My hope is to build on those efforts, and better understand how our local solutions might inform federal policy.",right
"I am pleased to say our experience has shown the best solutions to these problems are driven by water managers at the local level.",right
"We are fortunate in Arizona to have some of the best leaders and best water-management practices in the world.",right
"The domestic and international challenges related to this issue are real; now is the time to understand them and advance better water policies.",right
"I look forward to getting started.As we approach the Oct. 1 deadline when Obamacare begins to go into effect, it becomes more and more evident that the president's health-care law is not ready for prime time.",right
"Through our congressional oversight and the feedback we get from businesses and families around the country on a daily basis, we have seen just how frustrated people are with the impact Obamacare is having on their lives.",right
"It has become very clear that this law is unworkable.",right
"A CNN poll last week shows support for the president's health-care law waning, with only 39 percent of Americans now in favor of Obamacare, down from 51 percent in January.",right
"With the Obama administration's decisions to delay several parts of the health-care law, including the employer mandate, it is clear that even the White House now recognizes what the rest of America already knows: Obamacare is a train wreck.",right
"Businesses small and large across our states have shared stories about the burdens Obamacare is placing on them.",right
"Couple that with the most recent jobs numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it is difficult not to conclude that Obamacare is having a dampening effect on the country's economy.",right
"That is why we have introduced legislation that would delay all Obamacare provisions and taxes for one year.",right
"H.R.",right
"2809 and S. 1490 seek to postpone all provisions of the Affordable Care Act taking effect on Jan. 1, 2014 or later by one year from the date of enactment.",right
"Delaying Obamacare is a necessary step in our efforts to get this law off the books and replace it with real health-care solutions that work for American families and businesses.",right
"It builds on efforts already taken by the House and Senate to delay both the individual and employer mandates.",right
"In fairness to American taxpayers, the best thing we can do right now is to implement a one-year delay so we can continue to chip away at this disastrous law.",right
"Postponing Obamacare gives us the best chance to defund it.",right
"If we delay the law, the administration will be unable to collect new taxes, provide subsidies or expand Medicaid -- all things that put taxpayers further on the hook.",right
"As Republicans continue to work to implement real health-care solutions for Americans, our legislation is the right step to take.",right
"In fairness to taxpayers, our best option today is to delay Obamacare's implementation for one year and continue to work to enact policies that put patients and doctors in charge of health care and do not require trillions of dollars of taxpayer money.",right
"When I was a graduate student and Senate intern in the late 1980s, my master's thesis proved to be a rather shallow attempt to explain Robert Mugabe's hold on the Zimbabwean electorate nearly a decade removed from independence.",right
"Twenty-five years later, that hold on the electorate has long since been exposed as brute force and chicanery.",right
"What is left to explain is Mugabe's mystifying hold on the rest of Africa.",right
"Western media and election observers were notably - and forcibly - absent during Zimbabwe's July 31 contest, but there was a robust presence by Southern African Development Community (SADC) and African Union (AU) election observers.",right
"Nevertheless, despite clear, abundant and still-mounting evidence of a deeply flawed election process, SADC and the AU seem eager to give Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party a pass.",right
"While final reports have yet to be issued, SADC's has already declared the Zimbabwe election free and peaceful, and the AU has affirmed it as credible.",right
"Note the absence of the word fair.",right
"But why quibble?",right
"The whole of Africa is sending us messages of congratulations to say 'well done,'  was Mugabe's interpretation.",right
"And who can blame him.",right
"That Zimbabwe would have another deeply flawed election is not news to anyone who has followed Mugabe's ham-handed rule over the past 33 years.",right
"But to those who are hoping that Africa is indeed turning the corner in terms of politics and governance, such a response in the wake of the election is deeply concerning.",right
"There is much to commend in the founding charters and principles of both SADC and the AU.",right
"Cooperation and coordination through these institutions has strengthened individual economies and provided a useful tool to address cross-border and regional security and governance issues.",right
"The potential for future collaboration is even greater.",right
"Which is why it is so puzzling that SADC and the AU would so willingly jettison their own principles when it comes to elections in Zimbabwe.",right
"Again, this is not an example of the West holding nascent democracies to unreasonably high electoral standards.",right
"It is simply a matter of asking SADC and the AU to abide by their own standards and live up to their own charters.",right
"SADC's Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections provide for its observer role during member state elections, to ensure full participation of the citizens in the political process by certifying, among other things, the existence of [an] updated and accessible voters roll.",right
"Such rolls were neither updated nor accessible during the Zimbabwe elections.",right
"Likewise, the AU's Guidelines for Electoral Observations call for competent accountable electoral institutions to take all necessary measures to ensure such essentials as equal access to public media by competing parties.",right
"There was not even a pretense of equal access to state media during Zimbabwe's election season.",right
"In the founding document of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, African heads of state hailed the emergence of democratic regimes and committed African leaders to take responsibility for promoting human rights ... by developing clear standards of accountability, transparency and participatory governance.",right
"In the context of observing the Zimbabwe elections, only Botswana has been willing to take such responsibility.",right
"Botswana decried Zimbabwe's elections as not free and fair and warned that SADC should not create the undesirable precedent of permitting exceptions to its own rules.",right
"Unfortunately, Zimbabwe's course seems set for the near future.",right
"By the time official reports on the election are issued, ZANU-PF will have formed a new government.",right
"The Zimbabwean courts are unlikely to intervene, and Mugabe will go on making empty speeches about liberation while Zimbabwe, unable to feed itself and having lost its own currency, erodes its independence by the day.",right
"The final reports issued by SADC and the AU won't tell us anything we don't already know about Zimbabwe, but they will say a great deal about the direction that southern Africa as a region, and Africa as a whole, is headed.",right
"Will African leaders be true to their own undertakings and stand for the principles they have espoused, or will they bow to the knee of a desperate old man determined to keep himself in power no matter the cost to the citizens he claims to represent?",right
"After winning election to the U.S. Senate last year, I expected to be teaming up often with my fellow conservative Marco Rubio (R., Fla.).",right
"What I never expected was that Senator Rubio and I would be working on immigration-reform legislation with liberals like Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).",right
"While conservatives are justified in their skepticism of any legislation that Senators Schumer and Durbin sign off on, I hope we don't let their association with the bill that is now before the Senate overshadow the conservative elements that Republicans have included.",right
"The first section of the bill addresses border security.",right
"It requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and appropriates $3 billion to implement the plan with resources such as military-developed surveillance systems, additional Border Patrol and customs agents, and unmanned and fixed-wing aircraft.",right
"DHS is also required to develop the Southern Border Fencing Strategy, with $1.5 billion to ensure that all parts of the border that need a fence have a fence (some parts of the border are so mountainous that a fence would be impractical and redundant).",right
"Because DHS hasn't always addressed the situation at the border realistically, the bill requires that if they do not achieve a 90 percent effectiveness rate within five years (meaning that 9 of every 10 illegal border crossers is apprehended), another $2 billion will be spent to implement recommendations from a commission of border stakeholders, who, for the first time, will have meaningful authority to increase border security.",right
"This funding can be directed toward more manpower, technology, and infrastructure strategies.",right
"Additionally, the bill takes strategies and resources that have been effective in certain parts of the border and expands them to the entire border.",right
"Among these are 3,500 new customs agents, authorization to deploy the National Guard at the border, funding for more border-crossing prosecutions, increased funding for Operation Stonegarden (a program of DHS grants to local law-enforcement agencies to improve border security), more Border Patrol stations and forward operating bases, access to all federal lands, funding for improved radio communications in isolated parts of the border, reauthorized funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (to reimburse state and local law-enforcement agencies for jailing illegal immigrants), and deployment of Department of Defense border radar equipment.",right
"Another conservative concern with potential immigration reform has been the issue of amnesty.",right
"This bill ensures that no illegal immigrant will be given amnesty or rewarded for illegal behavior.",right
"In fact, no illegal immigrant will be given anything.",right
"Before any illegal immigrant can adjust to a non-citizenship provisional status, DHS must have submitted the border-security and border-fencing strategies.",right
"Only then will these immigrants be able to legally work in the country -- but they will not be eligible for government assistance (unemployment, welfare, Obamacare, etc.).",right
"Moreover, to be eligible for this non-citizenship provisional status, illegal immigrants must pay a $500 fine, pass a background check, and pay fees.",right
"And before most illegal immigrants can adjust from this provisional status to being lawful permanent residents, the border-security and border-fencing strategies will have to be operational and functioning.",right
"Additionally, every employer in the country will have to use the E-Verify system to check the immigration status of every employee hire.",right
"E-Verify is in use in Arizona, but this bill will make it mandatory across the country.",right
"Only after ten years can these provisional-status immigrants apply for a green card (which is still short of U.S. citizenship).",right
"In order to earn a green card, they will have to pay all back taxes, maintain employment in the U.S., learn English and civics, and wait until everyone who applied for a green card before them has been processed.",right
"It will likely be close to 13 years before current illegal immigrants begin to become eligible for citizenship.",right
"It is a long and difficult path, but even though some law-abiding and productive members of our society will eventually earn that opportunity, not all of them will take it.",right
"Other measures important to conservatives, like an overhaul of the legal-immigration system with a shift to a more merit-based process and a more robust temporary-worker program, are also included in the bill.",right
"Conservatives worried that President Obama or Secretary Napolitano will be able to expedite the legalization sections of the bill while dragging their feet on border security should consider that the border-security measures come first, while the status-adjustment portions of the bill will take many years.",right
"It's also worth noting that it's likely that this process will occur under both Democratic and Republicans administrations.",right
"As this bill moves through regular order and is debated and amended, conservatives may not always agree on every aspect.",right
"But I think we can all agree that the status quo is unacceptable, and I'm convinced that this legislation moves us in a positive direction.",right
"When thinking of an event that occurs every four years, the Olympics usually come to mind.",right
"Not the introduction of a federal budget.",right
"But such was the case a few weeks ago.",right
"Earlier in March, the introduction of the federal budget became an event of Olympic proportions and timing when Senate Democrats released their first budget proposal in four years.",right
"While I have to give Senate Democrats some credit for actually offering their first budget in over 1440 days, I prefer budgets that actually balance at some point.",right
"Needless to say, I voted against this budget.",right
"More than $100 billion in new spending is included in the Senate Democrats' budget.",right
"These funds are dedicated for economic stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and job training, which includes funds to help accurately predict weather patterns.",right
"How about a complimentary forecast: By the end of this budget's 10-year window in 2023, more than $2 trillion in spending increases will occur - that's an increase of 62 percent over fiscal year 2013 federal spending.",right
"All of these numbers amount to $7.3 trillion in new debt by 2023.",right
"That's nearly $21,000 of NEW debt for every man, woman and child in the United States.",right
"One has to wonder when the debt crisis becomes an actual crisis.",right
"It is tough to fathom, but the Senate Democratic budget accumulates $7.3 trillion in new debt despite the $1.5 trillion in new tax hikes it imposes.",right
"This budget doesn't come close to balancing because their massive tax increases are wiped out by even more massive spending increases.",right
"Not surprisingly, the budget also fails to rein in the real drivers of our debt: entitlement programs.",right
"By contrast, the House Republicans' budget put forth by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan contains no tax increases, includes twice as much deficit reduction over 10 years as the Senate Democratic budget, and actually balances by 2023.",right
"The Ryan budget also begins to make entitlement programs solvent for the long-term.",right
"It reforms Medicare by offering a range of insurance plans such as private insurance or traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and increases means testing for Medicare, among other reforms.",right
"It is simply irresponsible to put forth budgets that jack up taxes on today's workers while ignoring the insolvency of the very programs these workers pay for and that many will rely on in the future.",right
"By making reforms to these programs now, we can ensure that changes will not affect anyone currently receiving benefits or those nearing retirement age.",right
"On the tax front, the Ryan budget not only avoids tax increases, it repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax, which notoriously hits the middle class the hardest; and it reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate - currently the highest in the world - to 25 percent.",right
"The Ryan budget is a responsible, serious budget that will foster economic growth.",right
"By contrast, the Senate Democratic budget, with its tax hikes and billions in spending increases, will only keep us on the same fiscally irresponsible and economically damaging path.",right
"We must work toward a final budget that significantly reduces federal spending and doesn't include burdensome tax increases, while also keeping in mind that the real drivers of our debt, our entitlement programs, must be reformed to ensure they're around for future generations.",right
"Both the Ryan budget and the Senate Democratic budget passed their respective houses of Congress, and President Obama recently introduced his own budget proposal.",right
"The House and Senate Appropriations Committees will soon negotiate the terms for federal spending described in each of the budget proposals.",right
"When this process starts, prepare to watch the real Olympic-sized budget games begin.",right
"Last month, a bipartisan group of U.S.",right
"Senators, the so-called Gang of Eight, offered a framework to address immigration reform.",right
"I'm proud to be a member of the group, along with Senators McCain (R-AZ), Schumer (D-NY), Graham (R-SC), Durbin (D-IL), Rubio (R-FL), Menendez (D-NJ), and Bennet (D-CO).",right
"Our proposal contains four major elements: securing the border before offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, reforming our legal immigration system to encourage economic growth, creating a temporary worker program to provide access to future labor, and strengthening employment verification standards to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants.",right
"One reason immigration reform failed in the past is because of the public's understandable mistrust of the federal government to adequately address border security.",right
"That mistrust is especially relevant now, with drug and human smuggling rings clashing along the border.",right
"Fortunately, the federal government has a model of what a secure border looks like.",right
"In the Yuma Sector, spanning 126 miles of the border, we have operational control, meaning that if someone attempts to cross the border, there's a reasonable expectation they will be apprehended.",right
"However, in the Tucson Sector, which is responsible for 262 miles of the border, we have nothing close to operational control.",right
"The framework creates a commission made up of border state governors, attorneys general, and citizens who live and work along the border that will make recommendations as to what constitutes a secure border.",right
"The federal government's failure to secure the border affects these citizens more than anyone else in the country, so because of their expertise and experiences, they should have input in defining what a secure border looks like.",right
"Only after the border is secured can illegal immigrants begin the arduous, albeit fair, process of applying for citizenship.",right
"A pathway to citizenship has been, and continues to be, the most contentious element of immigration reform proposals.",right
"There are some Republicans who believe that anything short of rounding-up illegal immigrants and sending them back to their home countries is an amnesty.",right
"I, as well as most Republicans, do not ascribe to this view.",right
"To gain legal status and be given a shot at citizenship under the Gang of Eight's framework, illegal immigrants must - among other penalties - pay fines, undergo background checks, and get in line behind those who are already in the legal immigration process.",right
"The framework also addresses the problem, in an expedited manner, of immigrants who were minors when their parents brought them to the country illegally.",right
"The framework would reform our current legal immigration system to encourage economic growth, as well as give future immigrants an incentive to go through the legal process.",right
"The U.S. can remain competitive in the global economy by offering more visas to foreign-born graduates of American universities who have obtained advanced degrees in the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",right
"If we want to grow our economy, we need the next Google or Intel to be incorporated in the U.S., rather than overseas.",right
"One major failure of the 1986 immigration reform legislation was its lack of a mechanism to deal with the demand for future workers.",right
"Our framework would create a robust temporary worker program to ensure that employers have access to labor in order to grow their businesses and the economy.",right
"But before they could hire temporary workers, employers would need to demonstrate that foreign workers would be filling jobs that Americans are unable or unwilling to fill.",right
"With access to a qualified pool of labor, businesses have no excuse for circumventing immigration laws.",right
"A workable verification system that allows employers to check a new hire's legal status, whether it be E-Verify or a new system, is needed so that employers can comply.",right
"Drafting a bipartisan framework on an issue as politically charged as immigration was not easy.",right
"It is going to be even more difficult converting the proposal into legislation and getting that bill through Congress.",right
"But I am optimistic about the prospect of finally enacting immigration reform this year.",right
"As Arizonans know better than anyone, we cannot afford to wait any longer.",right
"Once again, we see leadership attempting to fix a disastrous law that simply cannot be fixed.",right
"Obamacare is broken beyond the point of repair - and the only true fix is a swift, full, repeal.",right
"For this reason, I will oppose H.R.",right
"4118 and instead, work to pass a common-sense replacement bill such as my Patient OPTION Act.",right
"Under my proposal, health insurance would be cheaper for all Americans, even those with pre-existing conditions.",right
"This is accomplished through private sector solutions, such as 100% tax deductibility for all healthcare expenses, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, unlimited contributions to health savings accounts, and tax incentives to reward physicians who provide free care to patients who cannot afford health insurance.",right
"The Patient OPTION Act, endorsed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and FreedomWorks, accomplishes all this and more in just 77 pages.",right
"It is the true solution to our nation's healthcare financing needs - and it starts by repealing Obamacare in full.",right
"I urge my colleagues to reject this so-called Obamacare fix, and to instead bring forward a vote on the Patient OPTION Act.",right
"It is highly irresponsible to be giving the President a blank check to spend and borrow as he pleases - but unfortunately, that's exactly what Speaker Boehner's bill does.",right
"We cannot continue to fuel the President's spending addiction by increasing our nation's borrowing limit and leaving our children and grandchildren with bills they simply cannot afford to pay.",right
"Congress must focus on cutting spending and paying down our massive $17 trillion debt - not continue to destroy jobs and stifle our economy with more spending and taxes.",right
"It is time we fundamentally change government and return to the constitutionally limited government as our Founding Fathers intended - and that starts with stopping Washington's outrageous spending.",right
"Today I voted no to raising the debt ceiling - but I'll be voting yes for the future of your children and grandchildren, for a strong free market, and for the liberty and prosperity of our nation.",right
"Hi, I'm Congressman Tom Graves.",right
"Tonight, we heard the president talk a lot about our economic challenges, and the need for new opportunities.",right
"I agree that we need to get the economy going, so that millions of unemployed Americans can find good paying jobs.",right
"However, the president and I disagree on the government's role in this agenda.",right
"He sees Washington-and himself-as a source of opportunity, while I see them as the roadblock to economic progress.",right
"To explain, I'll start at home, in Georgia's 14th Congressional District.",right
"Last week, my entire staff gathered there for our annual meeting.",right
"Between planning sessions, we spent a lot of time visiting local companies and saw firsthand how thousands of Georgia jobs are created.",right
"After the tours, we talked about how these businesses do amazing and innovative things.",right
"The employees work hard to solve complex problems, and they lift up the communities around them.",right
"We also heard about the challenges.",right
"Company leaders passionately explained how good paying jobs are crushed by taxes and regulations.",right
"It's a hard truth that the president's vision denies.",right
"Too often, when a person in need reaches out for an opportunity, and a potential employer reaches back, the government is in the way.",right
"The president would rather promote the benefits of unemployment than address his policies that have blocked the paychecks and joys of true employment.",right
"He seems to be satisfied with you making a minimum wage, after his own health care law has forced employers to cut your hours and pay.",right
"These aren't plans for enduring prosperity.",right
"The government is just trying to fix its own mistakes.",right
"Solutions to poverty, jobs, higher incomes and upward mobility exist right in our local communities--in the entrepreneur's garage, or the research and development wing of a major company.",right
"So, how about this vision: Bigger paychecks through lower taxes and more hours.",right
"More health insurance options at a lower cost-through choice, not mandates.",right
"Access to more housing and job options through local control of transportation projects.",right
"Cheaper gas and groceries with a free market approach to energy.",right
"Freeing America's businesses to go on offense in the global market, rather than play defense against Washington's regulations.",right
"For us, in North Georgia, it just means unleashing all the potential within every person.",right
"Opportunity through freedom.",right
"That's the story of America's greatness, and the guide for enduring prosperity.",right
"On behalf of the 14th Congressional District, I thank our veterans in Georgia and across America.",right
"In serving our country, veterans and their families entered a life full of challenge and sacrifice.",right
"They ensured that the torch of freedom would be passed from each generation to the next.",right
"They are our heroes.",right
"While our country is sincere in its gratitude, it's important to acknowledge, once again, that our words must be backed up with action on fixing the veterans benefits system.",right
"This week, the Veterans Affairs Department cited progress on the infamous claims backlog, but I still believe our veterans deserve better.",right
"Hearing all the talk of 'tech surges' these days, I'm dismayed that the digital cavalry hasn't been called in to aid and improve VA claims processing.",right
"With the major increases in VA spending since 2009, we know the problem isn't a budget issue-it's a bureaucracy issue.",right
"Our government needs to set the bar sky high and think bigger.",right
"Enlist the brightest minds and best systems, then throw the current claims processing goal of four months out the window and aim for 30 days, or even four days.",right
"Our servicemembers set the standard for honor and excellence, and they should be met upon retirement by a nation eager to respond in kind.",right
"This is a major energy plan for America that will create thousands of new jobs and keep energy affordable for families, said Rep. Graves.",right
"Using a free market approach, we open our resource-rich land for competition and innovation across the full spectrum of energy sources, from oil to wind and everything in between.",right
"That also means eliminating red tape and excessive regulations, transferring more control to the states and ending special interest subsidies while lowering tax rates.",right
"I believe this all-of-the-above plan will unleash America's full industrial might and usher in a new era of prosperity and opportunity for families across the country.",right
"My heart aches for the millions of Americans who are suffering today because of President Obama's broken promises.",right
"While there may not be enough time for insurance companies to reopen health care plans that have been canceled, I voted for this bill with the hope that it might save even one family I represent from losing a plan they want to keep.",right
"After six disastrous weeks, I believe the best way to fix Obamacare is to repeal the law.",right
"I thank the 61 House Republicans who joined me yesterday in support of our Fairness Amendment to delay Obamacare for one year.",right
"Our combined effort proved successful as House Republicans have decided to incorporate the one year delay policy in the government funding bill we expect to vote on today.",right
"It is reasonable, and right, to demand that every American gets the same Obamacare delay that the president gave to businesses and insurance companies.",right
"I thank leadership for, once again, listening to the conference and moving forward with policies that unite us as we work to keep the government open and protect our constituents from the harmful effects of Obamacare.",right
"I encourage every House Republican to support this bill because it achieves the two goals that unite us all: keeping the government open and protecting our constituents from the harmful effects of Obamacare.",right
"With the Defund Obamacare Act now inserted into the bill, we are making a genuine attempt to stop the law before it starts on October 1.",right
"I thank the 79 cosponsors of the Stability, Security and Fairness Resolution, and the 148 cosponsors of the Defund Obamacare Act, for raising their voices at critical times this year.",right
"I credit House leadership for listening to us and responding to the demands of the American people.",right
"Now it's up to Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats to explain why Obamacare is too dangerous for businesses, but still being enforced on families.",right
"They must explain why special interests get waivers and companies get delays, but the average American is still hit by Obamacare's trainwreck of fines, mandates and confusion.",right
"Today, we hold the victims of September 11 and their families in our hearts just as much as we did twelve years ago.",right
"We remember the first responders who rushed to ground zero, and the brave men and women in uniform who have confronted terror around the world in the years since.",right
"This day now carries the additional heartache and outrage of the Benghazi attack one year ago.",right
"There is no question that the fight against al Qaeda and Islamic extremism is not over.",right
"We must never be deterred from identifying our clear enemy-not by political correctness or by pretending they are any less determined to attack us.",right
"While there are many ongoing debates in our country about the complex national security issues borne out of September 11, 2001, this anniversary should always remind Americans of how we stood united in the midst of tragedy, and responded with courage and perseverance.",right
"Today was supposed to be an important milestone for ObamaCare but nobody is celebrating.",right
"After passing ObamaCare to find out what was in it, Democrats are distancing themselves from this political disaster.",right
"After promising Americans they could keep their plans, President Obama is holding this big government plan together with delays, changes, and a shoestring.",right
"After being sold empty promises, the American people are sick of the constant spin.",right
"Millions of Americans have lost their plans, families are facing higher premiums, and the White House has issued dozens of unilateral delays.",right
"ObamaCare won't work.",right
"It's time to fix our health care system, starting with patient-centered reforms.",right
"This is not about birth control, it's about government control.",right
"The First Amendment, the bedrock of our experiment in self-government, was meant to protect Americans from being forced to choose between practicing their faith and complying with government mandates.",right
"In a nation built on freedom and committed to religious diversity, men and women should be free to live out their convictions.",right
"Unfortunately, ObamaCare's intolerant mandate presumes that religious Americans can believe whatever they want, as long as they don't believe it at work.",right
"This is Big Government's arrogance at its worst.",right
"I'm joining with millions of Americans in hoping the Supreme Court will step in and stop this attack on the liberty that millions of Americans hold dear.The President can't pick and choose the laws he enforces.",right
"By making up the rules as they go-from gutting welfare reform to issuing politically driven ObamaCare delays-this Administration has defied our nation's constitutional checks and balances.",right
"Today, the House of Representatives passed common-sense legislation allowing Congress to authorize a lawsuit against the executive branch for failing to uphold its constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.",right
"If President Obama disagrees with the laws on the books, he should work with Congress and the American people to change them.",right
"That's what limited government is all about.President Obama has again demonstrated his unwillingness to tackle our nation's fiscal crisis.",right
"By suggesting that Washington spend an extra $791 billion, raise taxes by $1.8 trillion, and add $8.3 trillion to the debt, it seems no one at the White House knows the difference between a serious budget and a wish list.",right
"While I am pleased that the President's budget retains the strategic capabilities of the Indiana Air National Guard, I am disappointed that the overall budget continues the 'borrow, tax and spend' cycle that has already put taxpayers $17 trillion in debt.",right
"Hoosiers deserve much better.Americans don't want empty slogans and bigger government.",right
"Over the past five years, families have paid a high price for this administration's broken promises-smaller paychecks, health insurance cancellation letters, and fewer jobs.",right
"This isn't what a recovery looks like but it's the same, worn-out approach the President outlined tonight.House Republicans are offering an alternative.",right
"We've worked to empower families, expand opportunity, and end ObamaCare's pain.",right
"We've passed dozens of jobs bills-many with bipartisan support-to help get Americans back to work.",right
"If President Obama is serious about making 2014 a year of action, he should call on his party's leaders in the Senate to give these common-sense bills the up-or-down votes they deserve.I am humbled to join my pro-life colleagues here on the House floor and more importantly the millions of pro-life Americans across the country.Although this debate is often clouded by empty euphemisms like 'choice,' we cannot forget the human element at the heart of this issue.",right
"This isn't about abstract concepts, this is about babies-the most vulnerable members of our society.At the same time, we must show compassion and offer help to those struggling through what seems like an impossible circumstance.And as a civilized people, we ought to prevent taxpayer dollars from subsidizing the senseless destruction of innocent lives once and for all.",right
"After all, we're a nation founded to protect 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.",right
"'Madam Speaker, today we have an opportunity to do exactly that with common-sense legislation.Millions of pro-life Americans don't want their tax dollars used to subsidizing abortions.",right
"I urge my colleagues to support the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.",right
"Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans find themselves in the heartbreaking situation of losing their health care plans thanks to a broken promise that the White House is now scrambling to try and fix.",right
"Hoosiers like Jared from Woodburn, Indiana were told that they could keep their plans.",right
"But unfortunately, Jared found this cancellation letter in his mailbox on September 23.",right
"He's just one of the more than 3.5 million Americans who lost coverage under ObamaCare.",right
"For Jared, the timing couldn't have been worse.",right
"I am so pleased I had a role in drafting this remarkable document.",left
"It embodies the values we hold dear as Democrats and as Americans, and it sets forth our great president's vision for our future where together we will reignite the American Dream for all.",left
"Because the reality is: Four years ago, the American Dream had slipped out of reach for too many, and it had turned into a nightmare for millions.",left
"President Obama changed our course.",left
"He invested in our future and put men and women back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges.",left
"He raised educational standards, invested in early childhood education, and worked to make higher education more affordable for everyone.",left
"He invested in clean energy and enacted the broadest tax cut in history, reducing taxes on the middle class to near-historic lows.",left
"He saved the American auto industry.",left
"He produced historic health reform.",left
"And he put forward a balanced deficit reduction plan that will put us on sound fiscal footing.",left
"Today, our economy is growing again.",left
"Our platform states that America faces a clear choice: move forward as a nation where everyone has the chance to get ahead, or go back to the same failed ideas that created the crisis in the first place.",left
"We will move forward, not backward.",left
"Republicans will raise taxes on low-income and the middle class to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.",left
"They'll end the fundamental guarantee of Medicare that people have earned.",left
"They'll let Wall Street write its own rules again.",left
"They'll allow the secret and unlimited special interest money in campaigns to advance its dangerous assault on our democracy.",left
"They'll shred the safety net and gut vital investments in education, innovation and infrastructure in order to help the wealthiest avoid doing their fair share.",left
"And they'll allow insurance companies to once again deny health care to working families and interfere with women's health care decisions.",left
"President Obama and Democrats will not let this happen.",left
"We will move forward, not backward.",left
"We believe we are bound together by a shared set of ideals and values rooted in the notion that together we can overcome the greatest challenges that come our way.",left
"We stand for an economy that's built not from the top down but from the middle out and that provides opportunity for those aspiring to join the middle class.",left
"And we make ending poverty a national priority.",left
"We are a big tent party of inclusion, and our platform speaks to the aspirations of all.",left
"Our platform ensures that the opportunity to live the American Dream not only survives but thrives for generations to come.",left
"We can't afford to go back or abandon the change we've fought so hard for.",left
"We will not turn back the clock.",left
"We can move forward.",left
"We must move forward.",left
"And under the leadership of President Obama, we will move forward.",left
"Thank you.",left
"We finally, after 16 days, at the last hours, were able to get to some agreement that is really very short-lived.",left
"The continuing resolution only lasts 'til the middle of January-on Martin Luther King's birthday, ironically-and the debt ceiling expires on February 7th.",left
"So, this is merely kicking the can down the road, as they say.",left
"I think it's important, but I'm still trying to rationalize how the non-tea-party Republicans in the House can let the tea-party-oriented members in their caucus control everything.",left
"And it's really kind of disappointing, because you can't negotiate whether-over a dispute over one measure, which creates healthcare for millions of Americans that can't afford it, that we would close down the funding of the entire government.",left
"This is a tactic that is so obviously out of place and makes the legislative process literally unworkable.",left
"And so it's my hope that we can figure out a way to get this rolling again.",left
"Speaker Boehner is in an incredible position, and his legacy is going to be determined by whether he continues to cave in to the ultra-conservatives in his caucus or not.",left
"To his credit, it seemed to me that he wanted to be more cooperative, but he was afraid of even being dismissed from the speakership.",left
"I think he's over that kind of a hump, but it's at a cost of $24 billion, 800,000 people out of work.",left
"And then the government, after we signed it late last night, they say, All government workers, please come to work the very next day.",left
"No, no, not at all.",left
"And, you know, the president has been stable, and he and Majority Leader Reid, they set a good example for us.",left
"And I think that he's got to really create a legacy that has a lot more to do with putting everybody back to work.",left
"The recession is not over yet.",left
"The recovery is slow.",left
"Unemployment is still way too high.",left
"And there's so much more that we could do.",left
"And to think that you would have so many members, 144 in the House and 18 in the Senate, who would say, Well, there's nothing wrong with shutting down the whole government, not raising the debt ceiling, and really hurting the credit rating of the largest, most powerful country in civilization.",left
"And it's just unimaginable, the actions that they would turn to to get their way on a very small and modest bill, Obamacare.",left

"This bill places significant additional requirements for economic analysis by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), effectively bringing any efforts at rulemaking to a standstill.",left
"Let's be clear: the purpose of this legislative effort is to stop implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act dead in its tracks.",left
"After losing in Congress, the fight against the Dodd-Frank Act moved to the courts, beginning with overturning the proxy access rules they adopted under authority provided by that Act.",left
"Although I agreed fully with the SEC's position, a court found that the SEC did not meet its already significant requirements to conduct an economic analysis.",left
"After the proxy access case was overturned, the SEC adopted improved standards for conducting cost-benefit analyses.",left
"These procedures were cited by the GAO last December as having all the elements of good regulatory analysis.",left
"Basically what the GAO is saying, we took a look we studied it and they do a good job.",left
"Nonetheless, the bill before us today adds even more requirements, tying up SEC resources and putting it at even greater risk of litigation for every rule.",left
"Despite the assurances of my Republican colleagues that they are only applying the terms of an executive order to the SEC, that executive order explicitly protects agencies from lawsuits based on their economic analysis.",left
"HR 1062 has no such protection for the SEC.",left
"The Commission is undertaking a valiant effort to finish the Dodd-Frank and JOBS Act rules, even in the face of attempts by the majority to restrict their funding.",left
"As the SEC attempts to balance capital formation with the need to protect investors, this bill weights the scales heavily in favor of industry over investors.",left
"In fact, the words investor protection do not appear anywhere in this bill.",left
"Even without this bill, we can count on industry lobbyists to sue the SEC any time it sees a weakness in the justification supporting a rule, as they have in several other cases currently before the courts.",left
"And this bill does not apply only to new rules.",left
"This is extraordinary, and I want to say this so everybody understands.",left
"This bill would require the Commission to review every rulemaking ever issued - even those that have protected our securities markets since the Great Depression - one year after the adoption of this bill, and every 5 years thereafter.",left
"As a result, the Commission will be forced to divert resources away from other key areas, such as enforcement.",left
"This comes at a time when House Republicans want to hold SEC funding flat, despite the SEC's new responsibilities, the increase in the number of participants it oversees, and the growth of complexity and size of US securities markets.",left
"It is ironic that, as House Republicans push this bill forward, they also are calling for the SEC to speed up its efforts on JOBS Act rules.",left

"The Republican proposal also deceptively suggests that a repeal of the liquidation authority generates real savings to the American taxpayer.",left

"It is now time to recommit ourselves as a nation to the moral obligation we have in providing the long-term care our veterans so deserve.",left
"That commitment begins with Democrats and Republicans working together in Congress to make the issues of servicemember suicides and mental health care for our veterans a top, fierce and urgent priority.",left

"With the retirement of a generation of physicians, the aging of our population, and the coming entry into the system of some 30 million newly insured thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we do not have enough primary-care doctors to meet the demand, and the problem will continue to worsen without a major initiative to produce new doctors.",left

"Whether it's a spouse, friend or relative - we all know someone who - in the last few years - has fallen on hard times.",left
"And we all know the enormous strain, stress and heartache experienced by those families unsure of where their next paycheck is coming from.",left
"A large number of those who are unable to find work require new skills for the new economy.",left
"And it is our obligation to give them a boost while they refine those skills and identify new career opportunities.The budget, released last week by Congressman Paul Ryan, would eliminate nearly $11 billion in resources for small businesses, such as the promotion of trade and other support services, as well as $12 billion in loans from the Small Business Administration that provide owners with financing that would in many instances have otherwise been unavailable.",left
"Economists have estimated that these budget reductions would result in the loss of several hundred thousand jobs.The owners of small business have an important position in our communities - creating most of our jobs and providing goods and services that contribute to the culture of each neighborhood in our nation and, particularly, in Brooklyn.",left
"For generations, small business owners have applied their skills and, with hard work, started their pursuit of the American Dream, said Congresswoman Clarke, who as a member of the Small Business Committee in the House of Representatives has worked to increase loans to small businesses owned by women and people of color.I am disappointed that even as some of my colleagues in Congress are trying to eliminate programs to assist small business owners, they have continued to support enormous subsidies for multi-national corporations and lower taxes for the richest Americans.",left
"I believe instead that we will rebuild our economy only when we support the entrepreneurs who are creating jobs in every community in the United States.In many instances, women and people of color are not aware of pay discrimination, because companies refuse to allow workers to discuss their compensation with each other.",left
"These executive orders will, first, prohibit federal contractors from retaliating against workers who choose to discuss their compensation, and, second, require these companies to provide information to the Department of Labor on compensation by sex and race.Despite the enactment of laws that prohibit discrimination in pay, substantial disparities persist which demonstrate that discrimination has continued in many companies, said Congresswoman Clarke, who was an original co-sponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which allows victims to file a lawsuit based on each instance of pay discrimination rather than only the initial instance.",left
"Often, it has been extremely difficult for the victims of pay discrimination to know their situation.",left
"I believe that these executive orders will establish that companies have a responsibility to pay each of their workers a fair wage, not based on their sex or their race.The problem of pay discrimination persists in our economy - women are paid only eighty percent as much as men, African-American workers only seventy-four percent as much as white workers, and Latino workers only sixty-four percent as non-Latino workers -and has actually become worse in recent years.",left
"Discrimination in pay has been illegal since 1866 when based on race and since 1963 when based on sex, but these laws have seldom been enforced until recently.Despite assurances by the federal government that it would focus its immigration enforcement efforts on criminals, about two-thirds of the people deported were not alleged to have committed any serious violation of the law.",left
"In addition, an increasing number of men and women have been removed from the United States in an expedited procedure that does not allow an opportunity to appeal the decision.This study only confirms the experiences of people in communities around the United States who watched as their neighbors and members of their family were deported for minor infractions, such as violations of traffic rules.",left
"We could not reasonably describe a person who has incurred a parking ticket as a 'criminal.",left
"' Yet the federal government has applied a policy of deportation that absurdly defines such men and women as criminals, said Congresswoman Clarke, who with several of her colleagues has asked President Obama to suspend deportations until the enactment of comprehensive immigration reform, which would allow many of the 11.5 million Americans without legal status to remain in the United States as permanent residents and, eventually, as citizens.The continued deportation of hundreds of thousands of people every year imposes serious harms on the families from which men and women are removed, as well as on the community as a whole, without any benefit to our society.",left
"Who could imagine that the removal of a father or mother from their children - for the 'crime' of violating traffic regulations - would not undermine the faith of those children in the due process of law or the good sense of their representatives in government?",left
"I remain committed to the suspension of deportation, and to a policy of immigration reform that recognize the value of families.",left
"These programs account for only a small percentage of the federal budget.",left
"Yet their rewards are enormous- for children who want to learn and adults who want to share in celebration of the diversity of our culture, said Congresswoman Clarke.",left
"As a child in Brooklyn, I had the opportunity to experience the extraordinary cultural institutions of Brooklyn.",left
"I believe that we have a responsibility to provide the same opportunities to the young men and young women of today, and for the generations that will follow us.Today, the NEA announced grants for several institutions in Brooklyn: Kyo-Shin-An Arts Inc., La Troupe Makandal, Inc., Make Music New York Inc., Music Forward, and Tri-Centric Foundation.",left
"These grants will support programs such as a showcase of Haitian art, a celebration of musician Frisner Augustin, a performance of The Classical Style, a semi-staged comic opera, Make Music Winter, an annual day of musical parades, residencies in Japanese music, and a celebration of jazz musician Anthony Braxton's legacy.The disparities that exist in health care create serious problems - for example, African-Americans account for disproportionate percentage of AIDS infections, elderly African-Americans are less likely to receive a flu shot, and African-American mothers have less access to pre-natal services.",left
"In many instances, even a small investment has the potential to prevent serious health problems and the substantial costs that occur as a result.The letter, sent to Chairman Jack Kingston and Ranking Member Rosa de Lauro of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, requests $65 million for the Office of Minority Health and $268 million for the Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, to identify disparities and determine cost-effective solutions, $30 million for the Minority Centers of Excellence, $21 million for the Health Careers Opportunity Program, $65 million for the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions, and $75 million for Area Health Education Centers, which support underrepresented minorities who want to enter the health professions, $50 million for the Centers for Disease Control Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health program, which develops community-based intervention programs.The costs imposed by inadequate investment in basic health care services - such as flu shots, screenings for diabetes and cancer, and the preventions of sexually transmitted diseases - are enormous, both on our health care expenditures and, more important, on our quality of life, said Congresswoman Clarke, who has worked in the House of Representatives to increase access to preventative services in the United States and around the world.If we provide adequate support for programs that have been demonstrated to reduce the disparities that now exist in access to health care, we will increase both our life expectancy and our quality of life as instances of chronic disease are reduced.The enthusiasm of people in states across the country has become obvious in recent weeks, as millions of Americans have learned that the Affordable Care Act offers comprehensive health insurance at a reasonable cost, without restrictions based on pre-existing conditions or discrimination toward women.",left
"In effect, Americans have come to learn that the Affordable Care Act offers a fair deal.",left
"I am proud to have voted for the Affordable Care Act, and to have voted to protect the law.",left
"As we continue the implementation of the health care law, I intend to work with my colleagues - both Democrats and Republicans - to update its provisions and to improve the quality of service.These enrollment numbers demonstrate that our parents were correct - without struggle, there is no progress .",left
"In the states that worked with the federal government, such as New York, California, and Kentucky, enrollment in health insurance marketplaces actually exceeded estimates by a substantial amount.",left
"And millions more Americans were enrolled in Medicaid in the states that chose to expand access to Medicaid by increasing income limits.In the states that refused to work with the federal government, however, the experience was entirely to the contrary - millions of eligible women and men who lack health insurance did not enroll in an affordable plan because even basic information was unavailable, and misinformation proliferated.It is my hope that, as more people learn about the benefits of expanded access to health care insurance in the states that have worked with - rather than in opposition to - the federal government, the people in states that have not cooperated in implementing the Affordable Care Act will demand that their elected officials support the desires of the people they represent and work with the Department of Health and Human Services to allow every American to purchase comprehensive health insurance.There were parts of this bill that I agreed with, such as the technical corrections to the long-term care hospital (LTCH) criteria which Brooklyn hospitals needed, said Congresswoman Clarke.",left
"Previously, in order to qualify as a long-term care hospital, overall  Medicare discharges had to not only meet certain pre-discharge qualifications, but also be 50 % of the overall number of  hospital discharges.",left
"While still requiring that 50% of the Medicare discharges meet certain pre-discharge qualifications, the technical correction would require those discharges be compared to the overall number of Medicare discharges and not the overall number of hospital discharges.",left
"I am concerned, however, that the extension of the 'two-midnight rule,' and the suspension of audits for those short-stay inpatient claims could have adverse impacts on hospitals.",left
"The delay in implementing changes to the 'two-midnight rule' and in initiating audits of such claims has cost taxpayers billions of dollars.",left
"Under the two-midnight rule, in order for patients to receive inpatient status, they must spend at least two-midnights in the hospital, otherwise they are considered outpatients.",left
"Inpatient costs are higher than outpatient costs.",left
"This arbitrary rule has forced doctors to make admitting decisions, not necessarily based on the needs of their patients, but rather on the rule.",left
"Additionally, because inpatient costs are higher than outpatient costs, the cost to taxpayers has increased.",left
"I am also concerned that reductions in payments to medical service providers will only remove needed funds from our hospitals and other medical facilities.",left
"This makes no sense.",left
"Congresswoman Clarke continued, I hope that we will ultimately resolve the deficiencies in the 'doc fix.",left
"' Patients need to have access to quality, affordable healthcare - which means that they need access to highly skilled and qualified doctors.I would like to thank the National Network for Arab American Communities and South Asian Americans Leading Together for holding this briefing and it is my pleasure to join my colleagues on speaking on this very important issue.",left
"This is important to us because the problem we are talking about - ending racial and religious profiling -continues to threaten our communities and violate our civil rights.A report by the New York Civil Liberties Union revealed that innocent New Yorkers were stopped by police and interrogated on the street more than four million times since 2002, and that black and Latino communities continue to be the overwhelming target of these tactics.",left
"Nearly 9 out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent, according to the NYPD's reports.In my New York District, under the guise of crime prevention, the Police Department has conducted investigations on multiple mosques, dozens of Islamic schools, Muslim student organizations, non-profit organizations, 'persons of interest' and locations they labelled as 'ethnic hotspots'.Our Constitution establishes that individuals are presumed innocent.",left
"The practice of conducting searches of young African-American and Latino men on the sidewalk, and the warrantless surveillance of Muslims gathered for study in schools and prayer in mosques, undermines our civil society's moral commitment to the personal privacy and dignity of each person.While we have taken certain steps recently to curtail these programs, it is unfortunate that today we fear those trusted to serve and protect us.",left
"We worry that our children will be harassed on their way to school, coming home from a basketball game, riding the train, going to the corner store or even standing outside of their homes.",left
"Young people of color are under threat; continuously fearful that they will be searched next, or that an officer will demand proof of ID and innocence whenever they desire, regardless of the circumstances.It is akin to living under apartheid South Africa.",left
"It is a national embarrassment.",left
"We most certainly have to address the issue of crime prevention in NY and in cities around the nation, but profiling, criminalizing and creating further distrust between police and the community profiling is by no means the answer.",left
"We must continue to speak out, and I will continue to push to garner more resources for activists and leaders who are fighting to put an end to discriminatory practices such as racial and religious profiling.Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties want to prevent women from purchasing health insurance plans that provide reproductive health care, such as birth control pills and other forms of contraception.",left
"Under the Affordable Care Act, unless they meet certain exemptions, employers must provide reproductive health care as part of health insurance plans for their employees.Let us be clear: these lawsuits involve only the issue of whether women have the right to purchase a health insurance plan that includes reproductive health services.",left
"Under the Affordable Care Act, businesses are required to pay for such services, unless they meet certain exemptions, said Congresswoman Clarke, who with ninety-three of her colleagues in Congress, filed an amicus brief in January urging the Supreme Court to uphold the right of women to purchase health insurance that includes reproductive health care.Congresswoman Clarke continued: These cases involve control.",left
"Will women have the right to control their health care decisions?",left
"Or will employers have the right to control the health care decisions of their employees?I am proud to join in urging Speaker Boehner to bring up the bipartisan, Senate-passed Unemployment Insurance extension bill for a vote this week.We need a vote for more than 2.36 million Americans who have lost their long term unemployment benefits, including 153,400 Illinoisans.We need a vote for people like Joseph from Chicago, who says, 'The unemployment benefit is my lifeline.",left
"It means that I put food on the table, have a roof over my head, and pay for phone/internet that I need to continue my job search.We need a vote for Jennie from Morton Grove, in my district, who says, 'I am not going to be able to afford the house that I have, pay my bills, make sure my kids are fed, keep my vehicle...I need this money to survive.",left

"'Passing this bill will help these families avoid financial disaster - and it will restore $300 million lost to my state's economy over the past three months alone.It's time for a vote.",left
"We must not go home for two weeks without getting the job done.I am deeply disappointed in the majority's decision further entrenching the bloated role money and large donors play in our elections.",left
"Much like their other ill-conceived ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, five justices on the Supreme Court have handed enormous influence to the ultra-wealthy at the expense of millions of everyday Americans.",left
"The removal of aggregate limits on campaign contributions - that is, contributions over $123,200 per campaign cycle, does nothing to make our government more accountable or responsive to the American people.",left
"The vast majority - 85% - of American households don't earn $123,000 total for an entire year's labor.",left
"Instead, this decision helps one group and one group only: the affluent 1% who think nothing of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to influence elections all over the country.",left
"Money needs to play a smaller role in politics - not larger.",left
"Allowing the dollars of a privileged few to play an even bigger role will only further dilute the ability of millions of Americans to have their concerns heard.",left

"I will continue to strongly support legislative initiatives like H.R.",left
"20, the Government By the People Act, a bill that would amplify the impact of everyday citizens contributing to campaigns, and I will continue to take whatever steps I can to reverse these harmful decisions and restore American democracy for its citizens.The fact that 13 people lost their lives is extremely tragic, and it is even more painful because these deaths were avoidable.GM made the decision to continue the use of a faulty ignition switch that did not meet its own specifications - a part that costs 57 cents.",left
"I am outraged that proposed solutions to the problem that could have prevented needless deaths were rejected for not presenting 'anacceptable business case.",left
"'The untold number of injured and the families of the 13 victims who died as a result of GM's failure deserved better.",left
"They deserved the peace of mind that they and their loved ones would be protected with adequate safety and engineering features.",left
"GM failed them, as did the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which missed opportunities to call for an earlier recall.",left
"An outstanding question is whether GM will take full responsibility for allowing this tragedy to occur.",left
"The company has yet to fire any of its senior employees that approved the use of faulty switches in GM vehicles or explain what it will do for the victims who were injured and the families of those killed in GM cars.",left
"Yesterday, I joined with Rep. Waxman in introducing the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, legislation to improve the quality and quantity of information shared with NHTSA and the public, which could help to prevent a similar tragedy in the future.",left
"I will work to see it passed through the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, on which I serve as the ranking Democrat.In the meantime, I will continue to work to hold the top level executives at GM accountable, to ensure that GM does right by the victims and their families, and to ensure that this tragedy is never repeated.Yesterday I supported the two Ukrainian aid bills voted on in the House of Representatives.",left
"I strongly support the Ukrainian people and their right to self-governance, and I believe that the United States must continue taking an active role in this ongoing situation.",left
"These bills - passed with strong bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate - provide the Ukrainian people with the tools they need to keep their civic institutions functioning and avoid a disastrous default in the lead-up to their May 2014 elections.",left

"Of these millions of Americans, many are now insured for first time, finally getting the coverage they need.",left
"This is truly a monumental accomplishment.We have reached these goals despite massive Republican efforts, including those from people like the Koch Brothers, spending millions of dollars to misinform people about Obamacare.With Obamacare in place, no American, including 5.6 million Illinoisans, can ever again be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing condition.",left
"In Illinois, 125,000 young adults, under the age of 26, can now stay on their parents' health plans.",left
"The unemployed, at their most vulnerable point, have a viable option for affordable coverage so they could get the care they need to survive injury or illness, without being bankrupted by medical bills.Just over a week ago in Chicago, I joined with Get Covered America and Get Covered Illinois to host a 4th birthday for Obamacare.",left
"The most moving moments in our celebration were the speeches of the following three enrollees:William Zars, a former photographer for the Daily Herald had a heart attack and then during surgery had a massive stroke which blinded him in both eyes.",left
"He lost his job and later his wife, who also worked for the Herald, lost her job as well.",left
"Yet he was able to enroll in health insurance under the ACA; he has secured better coverage than he had before and is thrilled to have his new plan.Dywaine Betts is a career development counselor for a re-entry program for formerly incarcerated men.",left
"He was hesitant to enroll at first because he didn't think he could afford good health insurance.",left
"But, he signed up and now pays $190/month for his plan.",left
"He understands the importance of coverage because years ago he faced high medical bills from a bout with appendicitis, when he was uninsured.",left
"Since signing up he has been sharing the information with others, including many of the men he counsels, who are around his age.Erin McDonald has Type 1 Diabetes, was uninsured and scared when she had to get off of her father's plan when she turned 26.",left
"But she has enrolled in coverage and is very happy with her plan.",left
"She wrote a letter to the editor that was in the Chicago Tribune in February and won a contest for a video about Obamacare.These are three success stories out of millions.",left
"I am so glad we live in a country that is truly prioritizing the health of all of its citizens.",left
"I will continue to work with anyone who is devoted to helping as many Americans as possible enjoy healthy lives.If budgets are all about priorities, the Ryan Republican budget's priorities are all wrong.",left
"Think we need to prevent carbon pollution?",left
"The Ryan Republican budget reduces spending to address global warming, makes funding cuts to clean energy technologies and approves the environmentally-dangerous Keystone XL pipeline.Care about Medicare and Medicaid?",left
"The Ryan Republican budget turns Medicare into a voucher program, cuts $129 billion, eliminates free preventive services, and reopens the donut hole gap in coverage.",left
"Medicaid is turned into a block grant and cut by more than $1.5 trillion - threatening everything from health care for children to long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities.",left
"Want affordable health care?",left
"The Ryan Republican budget eliminates Obamacare's tax credits to help individuals and small businesses purchase coverage, lets insurance companies set caps on the amount of annual and lifetime benefits they pay, and goes back to the days when people with pre-existing conditions are excluded and women are charged more.Want to provide education opportunities?",left
"The Ryan Republican budget cuts college Pell Grants - calling them promises that cannot be kept.Think we should feed the hungry?",left
"The Ryan Republican budget would cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - the nation's best anti-hunger program, formerly called food stamps- by $125 billion.",left
"More than 60 percent of all SNAP beneficiaries are children, seniors, or disabled.",left
"Support the arts?",left
"The Ryan Republican budget zeroes out funding for National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and museums.Of course, not everyone loses in the Ryan Republican budget - the winners are the richest Americans and most profitable corporations.",left
"Both would see their top tax rates drop to 25 percent - increasing income inequality and wealth disparities that are already at levels not seen since the 1920s.This must be a cruel April Fool's Day Joke.There could not be a starker contrast between the Republican Party's priorities and the priorities of the American people.",left
"There is a better way forward to create opportunity and an economy that works for everyone through investments in education, job creation, clean energy, health care and retirement security.",left
"In 2002, a 2-year old named Cameron Gulbransen was tragically killed when his father unknowingly backed over him in front of his home.",left
"Hearing about Cameron's death - and the fact that more than 200 preventable deaths occur each year due to a massive blind spot behind most vehicles - was heartbreaking.",left
"Over the next few years, I worked with Rep. Peter King, the parents of victims, and organizations including  Consumers Union, Kids and Cars, Public Citizen and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety to pass legislation that would prevent backover tragedies in the future.",left
"In 2008, the Cameron Gulbranson Kids Transportation Safety Act - which I introduced - was signed into law by President Bush.",left
"The legislation required expanded rear visibility to reduce unintended backovers.",left
"After extensive analysis, NHTSA came to the realization that the only way to guarantee the expanded rear visibility my bill required in the near-term was through the use of rear visibility cameras.",left
"We understood the problem.",left
"We recognized the terrible cost of life.",left
"We knew how to fix it.",left
"Today, NHTSA made sure that auto makers will do just that.We can now celebrate a final rule that will prevent future tragic deaths, and I am glad that we are moving toward a point when no parent will have to suffer the trauma of losing their child because they can't see behind their car.",left
"However, I am deeply concerned that it will be 10 years between the passage of the law and a final rule, and I urge auto makers to act voluntarily to save hundreds of lives by meeting the standard before 2018.",left
"I am pleased with the NLRB ruling that correctly recognizes Northwestern football players as University employees.",left
"These young men dedicate 40-plus hours a week for much of the school year to the football program and they deserve the right to unionize.College football players have brought in billions of dollars for universities across the country, and in many cases their athletic responsibilities limit the classes they can take and their scholarships only extend as long as they are physically able to perform.",left
"I am particularly concerned about the health implications of college sports.",left
"As the dispute over medical bills resulting from Kain Colter's ankle injury highlight, athletes are not guaranteed healthcare coverage for injuries sustained due to collegiate athletic competition - including those associated with long-term impact.Northwestern is a model for ensuring that its athletes can succeed both on the field and in the classroom, with a 97 percent graduation rate that ranks the highest in the country among Division I programs.",left
"However, as Tim Waters, national political director for the United Steelworkers said yesterday, 'just because they're a good employer doesn't mean they're not an employer.",left
"' I'm proud that these young men are standing up and demanding a right to negotiate with the University.",left
"I hope that their success can be replicated across the country.Yesterday, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers proposed a new rule to protect the waters of the United States.",left
"The rule would make clear that the EPA and the Army Corps have the authority and responsibility to protect smaller bodies of water from harmful pollution - an authority which had come into question due to recent interpretations of Supreme Court rulings.",left
"U.S.",left
"Representatives Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Mike Quigley (IL-05), Luis Gutierrez (IL-04), and Brad Schneider (IL-10) released the following statement on the proposed rule:As members of Congress, we often hear from our constituents how important it is that Lake Michigan, the Mississippi, and all Illinois waterways are clean and protected.",left
"We applaud the EPA and Army Corps' proposed rule clarifying their authority to protect smaller bodies of water from harmful pollution.",left
"Millions of Illinoisans drink Lake Michigan water and spend the summers in the lake or on its shores.",left
"We must ensure that our waterways - including wetlands and small tributaries - are free of harmful pollutants that could make their way into our drinking or recreational water sources.Passage of the Clean Water Act 40 years ago was one of the most important and popular environmental protections in our history, creating a legacy of cleaner water in the United States.",left
"Today's proposed rule would ensure that legacy continues.",left
"We commend the EPA and the Army Corps for taking this action and will continue to support the agencies in their efforts to protect public health and the environment.I am incredibly concerned about the news of the Whiting tar sands oil spill and its possible impact on Lake Michigan, my constituents, and millions of other Chicagoans.",left
"Lake Michigan supplies drinking water for seven million Chicagoans, and it provides summer entertainment for swimmers, boaters, and beach goers.",left
"It is a truly irreplaceable resource, and the recent spill could jeopardize public health and the environment.",left
"I have expressed serious concerns about the Whiting refinery dating back to 2008 when it expanded operations.",left
"The refining of Alberta tar sands at the plant results in 17 percent more pollution than conventional oil, and it also results in high levels of petroleum coke byproduct that has built up on the South Side of Chicago.",left
"This spill suggests yet another reason that tar sands are wrong for our country and a threat to public health and our environment.",left
"Moving forward, I will continue to follow this situation closely, take any steps necessary to protect the waters of Lake Michigan, hold BP accountable for its actions, and ensure that this type of accident never happens again.Today I voted against passage of H.R.",left
"3826, a bill that would prevent the EPA from meaningfully regulating pollution from power plants - the country's single biggest emitter of carbon pollution.",left
"At a time when sea levels are rapidly rising and severe drought, wildfires, and hurricanes are happening with increasing frequency around the country, we owe it to future generations to take strong action against climate change.",left
"The Republican majority has not only refused to take Congressional action, with this legislation it would prevent the EPA from using its clear authority under the Clean Air Act to curb pollution.",left
"We cannot afford to stand by as the world warms - perhaps irreversibly - before our eyes.",left
"We certainly cannot undermine federal agencies that are taking responsible action.",left
"Fortunately, the Senate has no plans to consider the bill and the White House has issued a veto threat, so it has no chance of becoming law.There is still time to take action on climate change, but it requires an acceptance of the facts.",left
"I offered an amendment to the bill which would have acknowledged the scientific fact that 'greenhouse gas pollution is contributing to long-lasting changes in our climate that can have a range of negative effects.",left
"'  Only three Republicans crossed party lines to support my amendment.",left
"As I said to my Congressional colleagues, history will not be kind to climate change deniers.",left
"I will continue to push for Congressional action to combat climate change and to support the EPA's authority to protect public health and the environment.My District has been hit by a series of so-called '100-year floods', which have damaged the homes of many residents.",left
"Similar storms have impacted families all across our country.",left
"To address this issue, I was proud to vote for the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which passed the House yesterday.This legislation provides refunds to homeowners who have faced excessive premium changes; protects against catastrophic rate increases due to remapping of flood zones; reduces annual flood insurance rate increases; and clarifies coverage information for policyholders.",left
"It also protects small businesses, non-profits, and houses of worship against unmanageable rate increases.This bipartisan bill - which I cosponsored - is a clear example of how Congress can work together to address major issues facing our constituents.",left
"The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act will truly help homeowners to maintain economic security, even in extremely rainy weather.President Obama's budget request is focused on investing in an American economy that works for us all.",left
"This budget invests in working Americans and middle class families, creates good jobs, doubles the Earned Income Tax Credit, makes improvements to our infrastructure, supports 21st century manufacturing, and funds early-education and job training.",left
